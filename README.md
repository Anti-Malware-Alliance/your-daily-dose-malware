# Your Daily Dose of Malware
Tool to Harvest Fresh Malware Samples for Security Research.

# The Problem

Security Analyst are constantly in a need for Fresh Malware Samples.
The fight against malware is largely driven by ML Models that use static, or dynamic analysis. This is a large field of study. For this Analyst and Researchers require a large amount of Fresh Malware Samples.

As malware advances, new bypass techniques are been developed in a typical Cat and Mouse Game. Models need to be constantly evaluated against their real world performance, and be updated.

For this a recurrently refreshed Dataset is needed. Most Research on this topic provides a "One point on time view" where the researcher collects samples, train the model and publish results at this point on time. But later models are not been evaluated, or retrained based on a recurrently collected model.

# Solution

Currently looking for a Collaborator for initial write up.
