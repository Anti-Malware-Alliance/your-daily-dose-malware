# The Problem

Security Analyst are constantly in a need for Fresh Malware Samples.
The fight against malware is largely driven by ML Models that use static, or dynamic analysis. This is a large field of study. For this Analyst and Researchers require a large amount of Fresh Malware Samples.

As malware advances, new bypass techniques are been developed in a typical Cat and Mouse Game. Models need to be constantly evaluated against their real world performance, and be updated.

For this a recurrently refreshed Dataset is needed. Most Research on this topic provides a "One point on time view" where the researcher collects samples, train the model and publish results at this point on time. But later models are not been evaluated, or retrained based on a recurrently collected model.

# Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anti-Malware-Alliance/your-daily-dose-malware.git
   ```

2. **Go to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd your-daily-dose-malware/
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv daily-dose
    or
   python -m venv daily-dose
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
    poetry shell
   ```

5. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
    poetry install
   ```

# Using CLI Interface
If you want to download fresh malware samples uploaded since 48 hours 
```bash
    cd your-daily-dose-malware/
    python main.py -s256

```
this could be an amount of 300 samples or more.

But if you're not that hungry, maybe 100 samples will satisfy your hunger. 

```bash
    cd your-daily-dose-malware/
    python main.py -hr
```
this will always download 100 samples. uploaded since 1 hour.
